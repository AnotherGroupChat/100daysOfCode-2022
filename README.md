## FAQ:

### What Is The #100daysOfCode Challenge?

100 Days Of Code is a social media project, primarily on Twitter, that anyone can participate in via the #100daysOfCode hashtag. Developer Alex Kallaway started it in 2016 based on the idea that consistency is the path to mastery. Plus, the hashtag fosters a sense of community—you can use it to see where others are at in their journey and to stay  motivated to document your own.
